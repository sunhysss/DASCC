# GPU-Accelerated DAS Ambient Noise Processing and EGF Enhancement

This repository provides a GPU-accelerated workflow for processing distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) ambient noise data, with enhancements for empirical Green’s function (EGF) extraction and cross-correlation stacking.

## ✨ Key Features

- **GPU-accelerated cross-correlation** based on [SeismicAmbientNoiseDAS](https://github.com/yanyangg/SeismicAmbientNoiseDAS)
- **Bin-stack-based EGF enhancement**
- **Phase-weighted stacking (PWS)** for robust cross-correlation stacking
